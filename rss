<p>There might be a time when you are inside a LAN and you have no access/permission to edit/change router configuration. This is where SSH Port forwarding comes in. It is also known as SSH Tunneling, as it can tunnel all traffic through SSH connection.</p>

<h4 id="whatisssh">What is SSH?</h4>

<p>Seriously? Ok, it stands for <strong>S</strong>ecure <strong>SH</strong>ell which works on <strong>TCP Port 22</strong> <br>
More about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">here</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>There are 2 types of port forwarding</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Local</strong> Port Forwarding  </li>
<li><strong>Remote</strong> Port Forwarding</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h3 id="localportforwarding">Local Port Forwarding</h3>

<p>When you connect to the local host's binded port, it will forward your connection to the predefined host's port. </p>

<pre><code>ssh -L 9000:localhost:22 r00t@b0x.xxx
</code></pre>

<p>This is done by <code>-L</code> Switch, which means Local bind. </p>

<pre><code>9000 = local port
22 = remote port to forward
r00t = username
b0x.xxx = hostname
</code></pre>

<p>When connecting to the local host's port 9000, it will forward the connection to the remote host <code>b0x.xxx:22</code>.</p>

<pre><code>ssh r00t@localhost -p 9000
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h3 id="remoteportforwarding">Remote Port Forwarding</h3>

<p>This is quite the opposite of <strong>Local Port Forwarding</strong>. When the connection on specified port is received on remote host, it will forward the connection to the local host's specified port. </p>

<pre><code>ssh -R 9000:localhost:22 r00t@b0x.xxx`
</code></pre>

<p><code>-R</code> parameter is used here which denotes "Remote" port forwarding</p>

<pre><code>9000 = local port
22 = remote port
r00t = username
b0x.xxx = hostname
</code></pre>

<p>This works in a opposite way of Local port forwarding. When you do a <code>ssh r00t@b0x.xxx -p 9000</code> you will be forwarded to your localhost. You can now log in to your local host without doing port forwarding from your router. </p>

<hr>

<p>Like I mentioned from the start, this is also called <strong>SSH Tunneling</strong> which means it can tunnel any protocol, any services, not just SSH. This is particularly useful in cases when you are behind a <strong>firewall</strong> or <strong>NAT</strong> router and they blocked the ports.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Welcome to Ghost]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>You're live!

Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at <code>&lt;your blog URL&gt;/ghost/</code>. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!</p>

<h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h2>

<p>Ghost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!</p>

<p>Writing in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use <em>shortcuts</em> to <strong>style</strong> your content. For example, a list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Item number one</li>
<li>Item number two
<ul><li>A nested item</li></ul></li>
<li>A final item</li>
</ul>

<p>or with numbers!</p>

<ol>
<li>Remember to buy some milk  </li>
<li>Drink the milk  </li>
<li>Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="links">Links</h3>

<p>Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in a URL, like <a href="http://ghost.org">http://ghost.org</a> - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to <a href="http://ghost.org">the Ghost website</a>. Neat.</p>

<h3 id="whataboutimages">What about Images?</h3>

<p>Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:</p>

<p><img src="https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png" alt="The Ghost Logo"></p>

<p>Not sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:</p>

<h3 id="quoting">Quoting</h3>

<p>Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. Perhaps you've started using a new blogging platform and feel the sudden urge to share their slogan? A quote might be just the way to do it!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ghost - Just a blogging platform</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="workingwithcode">Working with Code</h3>

<p>Got a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.</p>

<pre><code>.awesome-thing {
    display: block;
    width: 100%;
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="readyforabreak">Ready for a Break?</h3>

<p>Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="advancedusage">Advanced Usage</h3>

<p>There's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.</p>

<p><input type="text" placeholder="I'm an input field!"></p>

<p>That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
